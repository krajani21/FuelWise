## Overview

FuelWise is a full-stack web app that helps users find the most cost-effective fuel stations based on their location, travel distance, and fuel prices. It leverages Google Maps APIs and a custom backend for real-time comparisons. The frontend is built with React, and the backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Core Features (Implemented)

### 1. **Location-Aware Fuel Station Listing**

- Automatically fetches the user's current location using the Geolocation API.
- Retrieves nearby fuel stations from the backend based on coordinates.
- Supports sorting by total fuel cost (volume-based) or by shortest distance.

### 2. **Google Maps Navigation**

- Clicking a fuel station opens Google Maps in a new tab with directions from the user's current location.
- Navigation mode defaults to **driving**.

### 3. **Dynamic Fuel Station Data**

- Uses the Google Maps Places API to fetch real-time fuel prices and distances.
- Stations are displayed in visually styled cards with clean in-line styles or CSS modules.

### 4. **User Authentication**

- Secure signup and login via JWT-based authentication.
- Tokens stored in localStorage.
- Protected routes (`/volume`, `/distance`) secured via context-based or HOC-style `PrivateRoute` components.

### 5. **UI Cleanup and UX Enhancements**

- Refine styling for:
  - Station cards (hover effects, gradients, padding).
  - Buttons (e.g., ‚ÄúSort‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet Directions‚Äù).
  - Headers and mobile spacing.
- Apply consistent theming across components.

## Features to Be Implemented


### 1. **Search Radius Filter**

- Add input/slider for users to set a search radius (e.g., 5 km, 10 km).
- Backend filters stations accordingly using the Places API.

### 2. **Display of Fuel Types**

- Show available fuel types (Regular, Premium, Diesel).
- Update API to support price data per fuel type.
- Frontend UI with dropdown or tabs for toggling fuel types.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **APIs:** Google Maps (Distance Matrix, Places), Geolocation API

---

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** Vercel  
- **Backend:** Render  
- Environment variables used for API keys and MongoDB URI.

---

## Next Steps

1. Finalize auth flows (including loading states and error handling).
2. Refactor UI components and simplify global styling.
3. Implement radius-based station filtering.
4. Extend the data model to include fuel types.
5. Test mobile usability and optimize performance.

---

## Notes

- Prioritize speed and simplicity in UX.
- Securely handle user tokens.
- Consider caching frequent station data to reduce API calls.
- Add loading spinners for slow responses.
